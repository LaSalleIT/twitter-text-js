h1. Twitter Text in javascript

An autolinking and extracting library for use in the DOM.

More info on twitter-text "here":http://engineering.twitter.com/2010/02/introducing-open-source-twitter-text.html

Based of the "twitter-text-rb library":http://github.com/mzsanford/twitter-text-rb

Main goal is to achieve 100 percent conformance.  More about conformance "here":http://github.com/mzsanford/twitter-text-conformance

To run the conformance tests just open test/test.html in your browser.

h2. How To:

* Download the project from "github":http://github.com/rubymaverick/twitter-text-js.
* Include the lib/twitter-text.js file in your html.

h2. Testing:

* First, generate the test.html file by running @rake generate_tests@ in the project root.  This uses the test.html.erb file to generate tests, converting  the twitter-text-conformance yaml files to json and writing tests against those.  Then just open up test.html in your browser to run the tests.  If you change the test.html.erb file than you have to run @rake generate_tests@ again.

h2. Examples:

@TwitterText.auto_link("This is a #tweet with a @username");@
@// This is a <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=tweet">#tweet</a> with a <a href="http://twitter.com/username">username</a>@
  
h2. TODO:

* Figure out the last couple of url regexp bugs
* Convert to Node.js?
